Our Bayesian model told us that the odds given to us by DraftKings were always lower than 50%. That is because the betted score was the center of a normal distribution, which as we know is symmetric, which means that the areas "over" and "under", are less than or equal to 50%. Here we will see if the Maximum Likelihood Estimate with Multiple Regression yields corrobating evidence.

Firstly, a brief foret into why the MLE is also the multiple regression model we will build please inspect this : https://www.statlect.com/fundamentals-of-statistics/linear-regression-maximum-likelihood

## New Approach

Basketball has many variables that affect the score. Like Horse racing where people have modeled the wind speed, crash %, speed, and acceleration to predict finishing time, so we can use features like 3 point percentage, rebounds per game, and assists per game to predict the overall score.

We first train the model on the games of this 2021-22 season, since the game itself has changed, and we train on the features of the visiting and home team's respective Field Goal Percentage, 3 point percentage, total rebounds, total assists, and free throw percentage to predict the total score of a given game. We will add 2 additional features based on domain expertise and that is whether the home team was rested or not (a boolean feature) and whether the visiting team was rested or not.  Next we will painstakingly generate these figures by hand based on the information we have at game time, that is which players are actually playing tonight, whose at home, and whose rested. We get the averages of the percentages and the totals of the raw numbers for the players present at the time. Then, for our actual fitting of the model we will filter it for just the teams playing the game tonight and only upon instances where they were operating in the same circumstances (home/rested, home/not rested, etc). Then we will predict with the features of each respective rosters of that night. 

For example in the Denver Nuggets vs LA Clippers game, we will be predicting with these truncated rosters that played that night:

With these features in play, we miraculously predicted the same exact number given on DraftKings and generated by our Bayesian model: 211.

This concludes our investigation.
